"TrainThreads" is a Java application designed to manage trains made up of locomotives and wagons, with the goal of demonstrating multithreading in Java.

This project simulates and maintains the logistics of railway infrastructure, including railway stations, connections, line intersections, and different types of trains. The application allows for the creation of locomotives, railroad cars, railway stations, and connections between stations, along with functionalities such as attaching railroad cars to locomotives, loading cargo, and managing train movement. Key Features:
* Dynamic train movement along routes determined algorithmically based on railway connections graph.
* Real-time speed adjustments for locomotives.
* Exception handling for hazards such as exceeding speed limits.
* Reporting functionalities to display train information, cargo details, and distance completion percentage.
* Automatic periodic saving of trainset information to file.

The application is designed to provide a practical example for studying object-oriented programming concepts in Java, such as classes and objects, while also demonstrating multithreading concepts, incorporates inheritance, collections, interfaces, lambda expressions, Java Generics, and other Java language features.
